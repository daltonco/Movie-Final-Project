        This is Group 8's Final Project Submission for Web Server Application Development, Spring 2023. Our group consists of Colton Dalton, Ethan Finch, and Rishabh
        Sharma. For our Final Project, we have created a Web Application containing data on our favorite movies, as well as additional pages containing information about
        us as individuals.
